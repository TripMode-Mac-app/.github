## What is TripMode for Mac?

TripMode is a lightweight yet powerful application designed to help Mac users manage their internet traffic efficiently. It prevents unnecessary data usage by allowing only selected apps to access the internet while blocking others. This is especially useful when using mobile hotspots, limited data plans, or public Wi-Fi.

With TripMode, you can avoid surprise data overages caused by background updates, cloud syncs, or other hidden processes. The app runs quietly in the menu bar and lets you enable or disable internet access per application with a single click. It also provides real-time data usage statistics, so you always know how much bandwidth each app consumes.

TripMode supports all types of connections—Wi-Fi, Ethernet, and cellular tethering—and works seamlessly on all modern Macs, including those with Apple Silicon. Whether you're traveling, working remotely, or just want better control over your network, TripMode is the ideal companion.
